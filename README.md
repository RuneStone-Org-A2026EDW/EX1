## Featured Projects

### Intelligent PC Component Compatibility Platform

A web-based system that automatically builds optimized computer configurations based on compatibility rules between hardware components such as CPU, GPU, motherboard, RAM, storage, and power supply.

The platform evaluates technical constraints including socket compatibility, chipset support, RAM type and frequency, power consumption, PCIe generation, and physical form factors. The backend implements a compatibility and scoring algorithm that analyzes relationships between components, calculates a global compatibility score, and applies mandatory constraints (for example, matching CPU socket with motherboard socket, ensuring sufficient PSU wattage for GPU consumption, and verifying RAM support by the motherboard).

Beyond basic validation, the system optimizes configurations according to selected goals such as gaming performance, workstation efficiency, budget limits, or energy consumption. It ensures balanced builds by preventing bottlenecks (e.g., high-end GPU paired with low-end CPU).

### Intelligent Academic Performance Dashboard

A web-based platform designed to analyze students’ academic performance and support informed decision-making.  

The system processes grades, identifies critical subjects, and provides a simple prediction of academic risk. The backend calculates weighted averages, applies a basic regression model to estimate performance trends, and generates automatic alerts when risk thresholds are detected.  

The frontend includes an interactive dashboard with visual charts, a risk-level indicator system, and exportable reports. This project functions as a decision-support tool focused on early detection and academic improvement.
