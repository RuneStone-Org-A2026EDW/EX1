## Featured Projects

### Intelligent Team Management Platform

A web-based system that automatically forms work teams based on defined criteria such as skills, availability, academic performance, and technological affinity.  

The backend includes a matching algorithm that calculates compatibility scores between members and applies specific constraints (for example, requiring at least one backend and one frontend developer per team). The system evaluates and optimizes team composition to ensure balanced collaboration.  

On the frontend, users can view generated teams, manually adjust assignments, and analyze balance metrics to assess group effectiveness. This solution represents an optimization-driven approach to collaborative work management.

### Intelligent Academic Performance Dashboard

A web-based platform designed to analyze students’ academic performance and support informed decision-making.  

The system processes grades, identifies critical subjects, and provides a simple prediction of academic risk. The backend calculates weighted averages, applies a basic regression model to estimate performance trends, and generates automatic alerts when risk thresholds are detected.  

The frontend includes an interactive dashboard with visual charts, a risk-level indicator system, and exportable reports. This project functions as a decision-support tool focused on early detection and academic improvement.

### Personal Finance Management System with Predictive Analysis

A web-based personal finance management solution that helps users track and optimize their spending habits.  

The platform automatically classifies expenses into categories, identifies spending patterns, and predicts future monthly expenses using statistical analysis and a basic predictive model.  

This project demonstrates applied data processing, financial analytics, and practical full-stack development capabilities, making it a strong professional portfolio asset.
